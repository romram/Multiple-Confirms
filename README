Adds the support for adding multiple confirm boxes in Rails.

User will be prompted with multiple confirm boxes one after the other.

Example:
<%= link_to 'Delete User', user_path(@current_user), 
			:method => :delete, 
			:confirm => ["Are you sure you want to delete this user?", "Your action will be reported to the system administrator. Do you want to continue?"]
